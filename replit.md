# Overview

This is a modern marketing agency website built for "Ivox Scale" that showcases digital marketing services through a professional, bilingual web interface. The application uses React with TypeScript for the frontend, featuring a complete marketing agency presentation with sections for services, testimonials, contact forms, and company information. The site is optimized for both light and dark themes with Portuguese and English language support, ensuring accessibility and modern user experience.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The client-side application is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Component Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI elements
- **State Management**: React Context API for theme and language preferences
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling

The application supports multiple languages (Portuguese/English) and themes (light/dark) with persistent user preferences stored in localStorage. The component structure follows atomic design principles with reusable UI components in the `/components/ui` directory.

## Backend Architecture

The server-side follows a minimalist Express.js architecture:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for API endpoints
- **Development**: Vite integration for hot module replacement in development
- **Middleware**: Custom logging middleware for API request tracking
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract storage interface allowing for multiple implementations (currently in-memory, designed for database integration)

The backend is structured to be easily extensible with a clean separation between route handlers, storage layer, and business logic.

## Data Architecture

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Schema definition in `/shared/schema.ts` for code sharing between client and server
- Drizzle configuration supports migrations and database introspection
- User schema with UUID primary keys and unique username constraints
- Zod integration for runtime validation of database operations

**Shared Types**: Common TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas in `/shared` directory, enabling type safety across the full stack.

## Build System

**Development**: Vite handles frontend bundling with React plugin and path aliases
**Production**: Separate build processes for client (Vite) and server (esbuild)
**Configuration**: TypeScript configuration supports path mapping for clean imports
**Styling**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer
